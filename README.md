## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bradley

I'm Bradley, a fullstack Microsoft engineer and a fullstack software engineer!

I've spent the last several years being a "one-man band" supporting hundreds of users. I've spent my time doing
everything from developing our own line of business apps to fixing printers to improving automation and security posture
through Microsoft's Intune and Defender to helping carry boxes around - and much more!

Most of my Open Source work is done in organizations -

- @darbiadev - My main project namespace, pretty much everything I work on goes here.
- @reynoldsf - This one is for my family, it houses their "learn to code" repos and the documentation for how we set up
  dedicated servers for our video games.
- @letsbuilda - This is a bit of a random one, this is where I build a random thing and want to keep it somewhere. I'm
  hoping to start documenting these projects to be tutorial-like, where you can see how to get started building one of
  your own.
- @python-discord - When I was starting out, all I had was Google, and it was really frustrating not to have anyone to
  ask questions to. I am now a volunteer "Helper" on this Discord server, where I spend time helping walk people with
  all levels of experience through whatever problems they're stuck on.
- @Ukraine-Relief-Efforts - I help manage projects and organize development efforts for people that are working on
  projects to provide humanitarian aid and possibly lifesaving information to the Ukrainian people.
