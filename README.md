## The dog's name is Gracie

Of course you can pet her! 

Hi, my name is Bradley. 

I work as a software engineer, mostly building APIs and automations.

In my free time I hang out at @python-discord, where I am a volunteer teacher, event-running assistant, and devops team member.

I also created @letsbuilda as a way to help bring people together for group projects to help them learn about collaboration and explore software development, GitHub, packaging, publishing, and more!

I was the infrastructure lead for @Ukraine-Relief-Efforts, where our humanitarian projects introduced us to all kinds of people, like the _International Commission on Missing Persons_, who invited us to talk about collaborating our efforts. We were even [internationally recognized by the European Union!](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/open-source-help-ukrainian-asylum-seekers)
