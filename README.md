## Hi, I'm Bradley ðŸ‘‹

Most of my open source work is done in organizations -

- @darbiadev - My main project namespace, pretty much everything I work on goes here.
- @python-discord - When I was starting out, all I had was Google, and it was really frustrating not to have anyone to
  ask questions to. I am now a volunteer "Helper" on this Discord server, where I spend time helping walk people with
  all levels of experience through whatever problems they're stuck on.
- @Ukraine-Relief-Efforts - I help manage projects and organize development efforts for people that are working on
  projects to provide humanitarian aid and possibly lifesaving information to the Ukrainian people.
- @letsbuilda - This is a bit of a random one, this is where I build a random thing and want to keep it somewhere. I'm
  hoping to start documenting these projects to be tutorial-like, where you can see how to get started building one of
  your own.
- @reynoldsf - This one is for my family, it houses their "learn to code" repos and the documentation for how we set up
  dedicated servers for our video games.
